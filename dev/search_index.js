Although Jacobi-Davidson can be implemented with a variable or flexible preconditioner that changes each iteration, it is often more efficient to construct a fixed preconditioner for (A - tau B) or (A - tau I) for JDQZ and JDQR respectively. The motivation is that the preconditioner has to be deflated with the converged Schur vectors, which can be performed just once when the preconditioner is kept fixed.","category":"page"},{"location":"solvers/","page":"Correction equation","title":"Correction equation","text":"Preconditioners P are expected to implement ldiv!(P, x) which performs x = P \\ x in-place.","category":"page"},{"location":"#JacobiDavidson.jl","page":"Home","title":"JacobiDavidson.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This package implements the Jacobi-Davidson method for (generalized) non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems involving large, sparse matrices.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"It provides two methods jdqr and jdqz which iteratively generate a partial, approximate Schur decomposition for a matrix A or a matrix pencil (A B).

For the standard eigenvalue problem, the Arnoldi method would expand the search space using v_n+1 = (A - tau I)^-1v_n. This linear system must be solved rather accurately in order to retain the Arnoldi decomposition.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The Jacobi-Davidson method on the other hand is not a Krylov subspace method and does not rely on an accurate Arnoldi decomposition; rather it can be seen as a subspace accelerated, approximate Newton method. Each iteration it must solve a linear system as well, but the upside is that it does this only approximately. The basic premise being that there is no need to solve intermediate, approximate solutions in the Newton iterations to full precision.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This means that Jacobi-Davidson can use a few steps of an iterative method internally, optionally with a preconditioner.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Example","page":"Home","title":"Example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Let A and B be diagonal matrices of size n with A_kk = sqrtk and B_kk = 1  sqrtk.
